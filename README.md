## Yet Another Remote Control

Control your desktop / laptop via mobile phone. 

### Basic features:

Single remote will have the following features. One can switch between remotes
easily via UI.

 - Streaming mode

    - Play / pause actions
    - Change volume
    - Change brightness
    - Seek forward / backwards

 - Change window (Alt + Tab) - Also, let user be able to select it

 - QWERTY keyboard to allow writing text

 - Touchpad to control mouse

### Advanced features:

The remote will automatically be switched depending on the active window. For
example, in case the active window is Netflix and is playing some content,
the remote should automatically switch to movie mode.

 - Screencast from mobile to laptop, so that one can enjoy in a bigger screen

 - Gaming mode

 - Information about all opened windows and ability to jump to a specific
   window / switch windows via mobile touch actions (like mobile's default
   way to show running apps)

 - Customize theme of the remotes. Plug and play themes from website.
 
 - Allow user's to create their own themes and use it.

 - Netflix / Prime customization - example: skip intro, etc.

 - The remote should work even when the devices are not in same network.
   For that, we need the yarc server to generate a QR code and the client
   app should connect to the device over the internet.
